[00:21.93] The midnight darkness in her eyes (oh-oh)
[00:28.29] A thousand voices shattered through the night
[00:35.48] Seconds only pass you by
[00:41.47] A thousand reasons for me to turn off your lights
[01:05.97] 
[00:46.25] You're violet crazy (hey)
[00:49.50] It's what I'm meant to be
[00:52.83] There was no silence, baby
[00:56.14] Between you and me, oh
[00:59.76] And it drives me crazy
[01:02.59] Is this meant to be?
[01:06.38] I've been so tired lately
[01:09.60] Will you set me free? Yeah
[01:22.60] 
[01:13.09] (Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
[01:20.06] (Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, yeah-yeah)
[01:33.56] 
[01:26.54] Oh, we'll dance until we say goodbye (hey)
[01:34.99] A thousand miles between, there are only blue, blue skies
[01:39.49] Tell me where we are in a fallen star
[01:46.43] And as your eyes light up, catch me in a fairy tale
[02:11.93] 
[01:53.00] You're violet crazy (hey)
[01:56.16] It's what I'm meant to be
[01:59.69] There was no silence, baby
[02:02.77] Between you and me, oh
[02:06.39] And it drives me crazy (hey)
[02:09.45] Is this meant to be?
[02:12.70] I've been so tired lately
[02:16.21] Between you and me (you and me, yeah)
[02:34.71] 
[02:20.59] (Oh-whoa-oh-oh) yeah
[02:26.81] (Oh-whoa-oh-oh) ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
